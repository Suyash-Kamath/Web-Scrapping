Excellent question, and you're thinking like a real developer now! Let’s understand how **antivirus software like Seqrite** can affect your Python scraping scripts — especially related to that SSL error you saw earlier.

---

## 🛡️ What is Seqrite?

**Seqrite** is an antivirus + firewall software. It:

* Protects your system from malware
* Filters your **network connections**
* Scans and intercepts HTTPS traffic (to protect from phishing/fake sites)

---

## 🔍 How Seqrite Impacts Web Scraping

### ❌ **Problem: HTTPS Inspection (MITM)**

Seqrite (like many antiviruses/firewalls) acts like a **middleman**:

* When your Python code says:
  👉 “Connect to `https://www.yelu.in` securely”
* Seqrite jumps in and says:
  👉 “Wait! I’ll **check this website** before you access it.”

To do this, Seqrite often:

* Breaks the secure connection
* Inserts its own **fake SSL certificate** (to inspect the content)
* Re-secures it again

💥 **But Python sees this fake certificate** and goes:

> “Whoa! This isn’t the original certificate! Something’s fishy!”

Hence you get:

```
SSLError: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER or certificate verify failed
```

---

## 💡 So in simple terms:

| Without Seqrite                     | With Seqrite                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python connects directly to website | Python connects → Seqrite jumps in → SSL mismatch happens |
| Certificate looks normal            | Certificate looks fake to Python                          |
| Works fine                          | Throws `SSLError`                                         |

---

## 🛠️ How to Fix It

### ✅ Option 1: Use `verify=False` (temporary, not safe for sensitive data)

```python
requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False)
```

> This tells Python: “Ignore this fake certificate. Just connect anyway.”

---

### ✅ Option 2: Add Seqrite’s SSL Certificate to Python (Advanced, but safe)

If you want Python to **trust Seqrite’s certificate** (like your browser does), you need to:

1. **Export Seqrite’s root certificate** from your browser or antivirus.
2. Find Python’s **`certifi` certificate bundle**:

   ```bash
   python -m certifi
   ```
3. Add Seqrite’s cert to that `.pem` file.

This is a **one-time fix** and lets you use `verify=True` safely again.

👉 I can guide you step-by-step if you want to try this.

---

### ✅ Option 3: Disable HTTPS Scanning in Seqrite (Recommended for Devs)

Go to Seqrite settings and turn off:

> **“Scan encrypted SSL traffic”** or
> **“HTTPS Inspection”**

This allows Python to connect directly to websites without SSL problems.

⚠️ You must be careful though — don’t disable protection if you're browsing unknown or unsafe sites.

## 🔐 Summary

| What’s Happening                                 | Why It Matters                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Seqrite scans HTTPS websites                     | Good for security, but confuses Python                                               |
| It replaces real SSL certificates with fake ones | Python refuses to connect (SSL error)                                                |
| Solution                                         | Use `verify=False`, disable HTTPS scanning, or trust Seqrite’s certificate in Python |

Awesome! You're asking for **deep understanding** — and I love that 🔥
Let me walk you through it like a **movie scene** — in clear, detailed steps.

---

## 🎥 Imagine This: You (Python) Visit a Secure Website (`https://www.yelu.in`)

---

### 🎯 Your Goal:

Python script says:

> “Hey, I want to visit `https://www.yelu.in` securely.”

So Python tries to do an **SSL handshake** — like this:

1. 🔐 Python says:

   > “Hello Yelu! Please prove you are the real `yelu.in` and let’s talk securely.”

2. 🌐 `www.yelu.in` replies:

   > “Here’s my SSL Certificate, signed by a trusted authority like DigiCert. Let’s talk with encryption.”

3. ✅ Python checks the certificate:

   > “Perfect. Valid, trusted, matches the domain. Let’s go.”

🎉 Now Python starts downloading the webpage securely.

---

## 😈 BUT THEN… SEQRITE STEPS IN!

Seqrite (as antivirus) says:

> “Hold on! Before you talk to any website, **I must inspect the traffic** to make sure it’s not dangerous.”

So here’s what Seqrite does **in between**:

### 🪄 Step-by-Step: How Seqrite "Breaks and Rebuilds" Secure Connection

| Stage                                                                   | What Happens                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Python says “Connect to yelu.in”                                    | Python tries to start secure connection        |
| 2️⃣ Seqrite intercepts the connection                                   | Like a security scanner in the middle          |
| 3️⃣ Seqrite blocks the real SSL certificate from reaching Python        | Python never sees the real identity of yelu.in |
| 4️⃣ Seqrite creates a **fake SSL certificate** that says “I am yelu.in” | Signed by Seqrite itself                       |
| 5️⃣ Seqrite gives this fake cert to Python                              | Hoping Python will trust it                    |
| 6️⃣ Seqrite then connects to real yelu.in securely on its own           | Acts as a middleman                            |
| 7️⃣ Seqrite reads the response, inspects for viruses/phishing           | Good intention!                                |
| 8️⃣ Then passes the clean content back to Python                        | As if nothing happened                         |

---

### 💣 The Problem: **Python Sees a Fake Certificate**

Python says:

> “Wait! This SSL certificate is not signed by a real trusted authority like DigiCert. It’s signed by... **Seqrite**? I don’t know that. I’m not trusting it!”

💥 And then it throws this:

```
SSLError: certificate verify failed or WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER
```

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Why Browsers Like Chrome Don’t Complain?

Because your browser **trusts Seqrite’s certificate** already.

Seqrite installs its **Root Certificate** into:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Windows certificate store

So browsers say:

> “Oh this is signed by Seqrite? Sure, I know him. It’s fine.”

But **Python doesn’t know Seqrite** unless you:

* Import Seqrite's certificate into Python’s trusted list
* Or disable verification using `verify=False`

---

## 🧠 DEEPER CONCEPT: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) — But Good!

This process is called:

### ➤ **SSL Interception / HTTPS Inspection**

🛡️ Normally, this is a **bad thing** — hackers use this to eavesdrop on users.
But in Seqrite's case, it's a **trusted middleman**, and it's doing it to:

* Stop malware
* Scan file downloads
* Prevent phishing

So it's a **good MitM** done by your own antivirus.

---

## 🔐 Real-World Analogy

> You go to an ATM to withdraw cash, and the ATM asks for your ID.

🧍‍♂️ You = Python
🏦 ATM = yelu.in server
🕵️ Seqrite = a security guard watching from the middle

But the guard:

* **Grabs your card**
* **Talks to the ATM on your behalf**
* **Gives you the money**
* All while saying:

  > “Trust me, I’m doing this for your safety.”

But you (Python) say:

> “NO! I didn’t approve this. I don’t trust middlemen!”

---

## 🧪 So, To Summarize in Depth:

| Term                   | Meaning                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ SSL/TLS Handshake    | Secure chat setup between browser/Python and server         |
| ❌ Seqrite Interception | Seqrite stands between and replaces real certificate        |
| 🪪 Fake Certificate    | Seqrite pretends to be the website (for safety reasons)     |
| 🧠 Python's View       | “I don’t recognize this fake certificate. Something’s off.” |
| 🔥 Result              | SSL Error — Wrong version, untrusted certificate            |

---

## ✅ What You Can Do (Safely)

### 🛠️ Option 1: Turn Off HTTPS Inspection in Seqrite

(This lets Python talk directly to the website)

### 🔒 Option 2: Add Seqrite’s Certificate to Python

(So Python will trust the fake certificate, just like Chrome does)

### 🚫 Option 3: Use `verify=False`

(Skip checking — okay for practice, but unsafe for real-world apps)

Why Sequirete generates or gives fake certitiacate signed by itself to python , I mean what is the need of it ?

Fantastic question. And you're very close to mastering the deep stuff now 🔥
Let’s get to **the heart of why Seqrite gives Python a fake certificate**.

---

## 🎯 Short Answer:

> **Because Seqrite wants to scan the encrypted data.**
> And it can’t do that **unless it pretends to be the website** — using a **fake certificate**.

---

## 🧠 Okay, but why?

Let’s break it down with real-world logic.

### 🔐 1. HTTPS Encrypts Everything

When you access a site over `https://` (like `https://yelu.in`):

* The website encrypts the data
* Your computer decrypts it using the real certificate
* 🔒 **No one in the middle** (including Seqrite) can see it — it’s end-to-end secure

That's good for privacy.
But it also means:

> ❌ Seqrite **can’t inspect** what's inside that encrypted traffic.

---

### 👮‍♂️ 2. Seqrite’s Job Is to Protect You

Seqrite’s job is to:

* Scan downloads (e.g., `.exe`, `.zip`, `.pdf`)
* Detect phishing websites
* Block malware hidden in web traffic

But if all data is encrypted...

> 🔒 **Seqrite is blind.**

---

### 🛠️ 3. Solution: “Let Me Pretend I’m the Website”

Seqrite says:

> “If I can’t see the data... I’ll become the server!”

So when your Python code says:

> “Hey yelu.in, give me data securely”

Seqrite jumps in and says:

> “Here’s a certificate that says **I am yelu.in** — trust me!”

This **fake SSL certificate**:

* Looks like it's from yelu.in
* But is **signed by Seqrite**
* So it lets Seqrite:

  * Decrypt the response
  * Inspect it
  * Re-encrypt it
  * Pass it back to your Python code

---

## 🔍 Why It’s a “Fake” Certificate

It’s not fake in the sense of a scam.

It’s a:

* **Self-signed certificate**
* Created by Seqrite
* Only trusted if you install Seqrite’s root certificate into your system/browser

It lets Seqrite do a **"trusted man-in-the-middle inspection"**.

---

## 💡 Analogy: Airport Security

> You receive a **sealed envelope** (HTTPS response)

Without interception:

* You give the envelope to Python → 📨 Python opens it

With Seqrite:

1. ✂️ Security cuts open your envelope
2. 👁️ Scans for threats
3. 🧵 Tapes it back up
4. 👮 Hands it to Python

But Python says:

> “Wait... this isn’t the original envelope. Something’s off!”

Hence → **SSL Error**

---

## 🧠 Why This is Actually Normal

Antiviruses like:

* **Seqrite**
* **Kaspersky**
* **Avast**
* **BitDefender**
* **ESET**

All use this same technique:

> Create “fake” certificates signed by themselves so they can scan HTTPS traffic.

This process is called:

🧠 **SSL Inspection** or
🧠 **HTTPS Decryption Proxy**

---

Would you like a **diagram** to visualize this?
Or shall I show you how to **make Python trust Seqrite’s certificate** so your scraping works?

Absolutely! Here's the **clean flow** you asked for:

---

### 🔁 **HTTPS Request Flow with Seqrite Interception**

1. **Python** tries to connect securely to `https://yelu.in`
   → Sends SSL handshake request.

2. **Seqrite** intercepts the request before it reaches `yelu.in`.

3. **Seqrite** connects to the real `yelu.in` server on Python's behalf.
   → Gets the real response and certificate.

4. **Seqrite** scans the response content for viruses/phishing.

5. **Seqrite** creates a **fake SSL certificate** for `yelu.in`,
   → But **signed by Seqrite**, not by DigiCert or another public authority.

6. **Seqrite** passes the scanned response and **fake certificate** to Python.

7. **Python** sees the certificate, says:
   → “I don’t trust this. It’s signed by someone I don’t know (Seqrite).”

8. ❌ **Python rejects the connection** and throws an **SSL error**.

---

Let me know if you want this as a diagram too!


Perfect. Here's the **accurate, step-by-step flow** so you understand what really happens during Seqrite’s HTTPS interception — **like a security checkpoint**.

---

### ✅ Correct HTTPS Interception Flow with Seqrite (Step-by-Step)

---

#### 🧪 Scenario:

Your **Python code** tries to access `https://yelu.in`

---

#### 🔁 Actual Flow:

1. **Python initiates secure connection** to `https://yelu.in`
   → It expects a real SSL certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (like DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, etc.)

---

2. **Seqrite intercepts the request** (acts like a middleman proxy)
   → Python's request never reaches `yelu.in` directly at first.

---

3. **Seqrite makes its own secure connection to `yelu.in`**
   → It receives the real SSL certificate from `yelu.in`
   → It downloads the encrypted data (HTML, JS, etc.)

---

4. **Seqrite decrypts the content**
   → Scans it for viruses, threats, phishing, etc.

---

5. **Seqrite re-encrypts the content**
   → But **uses its own SSL certificate**, **pretending to be `yelu.in`**
   → That certificate is **signed by Seqrite**, not by a global Certificate Authority

---

6. **Seqrite sends the scanned, re-encrypted data + fake certificate to Python**

---

7. **Python receives the certificate**, inspects it and says:

   > “Wait — this is not signed by a trusted global authority.
   > I don’t know who Seqrite is.”

---

8. **Python throws an SSL error**
   → Example: `wrong version number` or `certificate verify failed`

---

### 🔐 Summary (One Line):

> Seqrite **breaks the secure channel**, checks the contents, and **forges a new secure channel** with its own signature — but **Python doesn’t trust that signature**, so it rejects it.

---

Let me know if you want this as a **diagram**, **code fix**, or **how to trust Seqrite cert in Python**.






 What verify=False actually means:
You're telling Python, specifically the requests library:

“Even if the SSL certificate looks fake or suspicious, don’t panic — continue anyway.”

 What is Web Scraping?
Web Scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Instead of manually copying and pasting data, you write a program that:

Visits web pages

Finds the required data (e.g., titles, prices, reviews)

Extracts it and stores it in a usable format (like CSV, JSON, or a database)
